# CS 51

This is a repo with my work in CS 51, Design and abstraction in computation.

The code solutions are each tracked in separate git repositories, so GitHub
classifies them as Submodules. To pull all code, see this [guide](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255).

_To clone the repo_
`git clone --recurse-submodules`

_To pull code_
`git pull --recurse-submodules`
